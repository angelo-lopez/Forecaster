# Forecaster
Weather Mobile Web App<br/>

A Local Weather web App. The app should display weather information graphically for a number of selected locales. Ideally, the app
should be able to store forecast data so that the weather data collected at the last access can be used if the device is currently unable to go online.<br/><br/>

Developed with HTML5, CSS, Javascript, JQueryMobile and Firebase.
